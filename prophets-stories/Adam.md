# Prophet Adam

### Informing the Angels About Adam
Allah the Almighty revealed:

*"Remember when your Lord said to the angels: 'Verily, I am going to place
mankind generations after generations on earth.' They said: 'Will You place
therein those who will make mischief therein and shed blood, while we glorify
You with praises and thanks (exalted be You above all that they associate with
You as partners) and sanctify You.' Allah said: 'I know that which you do not
know.'*<br>
*Allah taught Adam all the names of everything, then He showed them to the
angels and said: "Tell Me the names of these if you are truthful." They (angels)
said: "Glory be to You, we have no knowledge except what You have taught us.
Verily, it is You, the All-Knower, the All-Wise."*

*He said: "O Adam! Inform them of their names," and when he had informed
them of their names, He said: "Did I not tell you that I know the unseen in the
heavens and the earth, and I know what you reveal and what you have been
hiding?"*

*Remember when We said to the angels: "Prostrate yourself before Adam" They
prostrated except Iblis, he refused and was proud and was one of the
disbelievers(disobedient to Allah)."*

*We said: "O Adam! Dwell you and your wife in the Paradise and both of you
freely with pleasure and delight of things therein as wherever you will but come
not near this tree or you both will be of the Zalimeen (wrongdoers)."*<br>
*Then the Satan made them slip therefrom (the Paradise), and got them out from
that in which they were. We said: "Get you down all with enmity between
yourselves. On earth will be a dwelling place for you and an enjoyment for a
time."*

*Then Adam received from his Lord Words. His Lord pardoned him (accepted his
repentance). Verily He is the One Who forgives (accepts repentance), the most
Merciful.*<br>
*We said: "Get down all of you from this place (the Paradise), then whenever
there comes to you Guidance from Me, and whoever follows My Guidance there
shall be no fear on them, nor shall they grieve. But those who disbelieve and
belie Our Ayah (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, and signs and revelations,
etc) such are the dwellers of the Fire, they shall abide therein forever."* (Chapter
2:30-39, Qur'an).

**Almighty Allah also revealed:**

*"And surely, We created you (your father Adam) and then gave you shape (the
noble shape of a human being), then We told the angels, "Prostrate to Adam",
and they prostrated, except Iblis, he refused to be those who prostrate.*<br>
*Allah said: "What prevented you (O Iblis) that you did not postrate when I
commanded you?"*

*Iblis said: "I am better than him (Adam), You created me from fire and him You
created from clay."*

*Allah said: "O Iblis get down from this (Paradise), it is not for you to be
arrogant here. Get out for you are of those humiliated and disgraced."*<br>
*Iblis said: "Allow me respite till the Day they are raised up (Day of
Resurrection)."*

*Allah said: "You are of those allowed respite."*

*Iblis said: "Because You have sent me astray, surely I will sit in wait against
them (human beings) on Your Straight Path. Then I will come to them from
before them and behind them, from their right and from their left and You will
not find most of them as thankful ones (they will not be dutiful to You)."*<br>
*Allah said: "Get out from Paradise, disgraced and expelled. Whoever of them
(mankind) will follow you, then surely I will fill Hell with you all."*<br>
*"And O Adam! Dwell you and your wife in Paradise, and eat thereof as you both
wish, but approach not this tree otherwise you both will be of the Zalimeen
(unjust and wrongdoers)."*
