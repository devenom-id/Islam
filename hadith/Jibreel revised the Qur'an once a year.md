Fatimah reported:

>The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, "Jibreel would come to me to revise the Quran once every year. This year he revised with me twice. I do not think it means anything but that my term will come to an end. Verily, you will be the first of the people of my house to meet me.” So I wept and the Prophet said, “Are you not pleased to be the master of the women of Paradise or of the believing women?” So I laughed at that.
