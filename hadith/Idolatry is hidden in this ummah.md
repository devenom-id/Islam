Aisha reported: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said, “Idolatry is more hidden in my nation than an ant crawling over a smooth rock in the dark of night, the least of which is to love something unjust or to hate something just. Is the religion not but to love for the sake of Allah and hate for the sake of Allah? Allah said, ‘Say: If you love Allah, follow me and He will love you’ (3:31).”
