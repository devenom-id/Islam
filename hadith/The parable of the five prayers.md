Abu Huraira reported: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said:

> “If there was a river at your door and he took a bath in it five times a day, would you notice any dirt on him?” They said, “Not a trace of dirt would be left.” The Prophet said, “That is the parable of the five prayers by which Allah removes sins.”
