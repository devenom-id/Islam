Narrated 'Umar bin Al-Khattab that the messenger of Allah (saw) said,

>"The reward of deeds depends upon the intentions and every person
will get the reward according to what he has intended. So whoever emigrated for worldly benefits or
for a woman to marry, his emigration was for what he emigrated for."
