Zaid b. Thabit (Allah be pleased with him) said:

> We took meal shortly before dawn along with the Messenger of Allah (ï·º). We then stood up for prayer. I said: How much span of time was there between the two (acts, i. e. taking of Sahri and observing of prayer)? He said (a span of reciting) fifty verses.
