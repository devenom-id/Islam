Abu Sa’id al-Khudri reported that some people from among the Ansar begged from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and he gave them. They again begged him and he again gave them, till when what was in his possession was exhausted he said:

>Whatever good (riches, goods) I have, I will not withhold it from you. He who refrains from begging Allah safeguards him against want. and he who seeks sufficiency, Allah would keep him in a state of sufficiency, and he who shows endurance. Allah would grant him power to endure, and none is blessed with an endowment better and greater than endurance.
