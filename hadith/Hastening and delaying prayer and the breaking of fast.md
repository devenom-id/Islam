Abu 'Atiyya reported:

> I and Masruq went to 'A'isha and said to her: Mother of the Believers, there are two persons among the Companions of Muhammad (ﷺ) one among whom hastens in breaking the fast and in observing prayer, and the other delays breaking the fast and delays observing prayer. She said: Who among the two hastens in breaking fast and observing prayers? We said, It is 'Abdullah. i. e. son of Mas'ud. whereupon she said: This is how the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did. Abu Kuraib added: The second one was Abu Musa.
